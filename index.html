    <h3>React Native, Expo, MongoDB</h3>
    <p style="font-size: 20px">
      In order to create such an app where researchers can snap photos with or
      without an internet connection, and then display those images on a
      seperate website with an overlayed map, specific technologies can be used
      to solve many of these challenges during the development process.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p style="font-size: 20px">
      To explain this stack, I wanted to go over each technology and best
      explain what problem it helps to solve, starting with React Native and
      Expo. To start, React Native is an easy choice when it comes to developing
      the frontend of our mobile application. With React Native, we won't have
      to develop two seperate code bases for both Android and iOS. Additionally,
      Expo is a very powerful toolkit that goes hand in hand with React Native.
      With Expo, the development of the application should be much smoother, and
      Expo provides us with specific components that could help develop certain
      features necessary to build the mobile app. For example, Expo comes with
      both a
      <a href="https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/camera/"
        >camera component</a
      >
      and a module for reading
      <a href="https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/location/"
        >geolocation data</a
      >
      from the device. These tools could possibly help with taking the pictures
      of certain POIs and automatically saving those pictures with geolocation
      data to then be handled by our backend. Lastly, both React Native and Expo
      support web-application development using React DOM, meaning we could
      likely use the same codebase for developing the webpage where the location
      data will be displayed.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p style="font-size: 20px">
      For the business logic, I wanted to find technologies to keep the app
      lightweight yet scalable, as the features described are not too extensive
      and shouldn't require a large and cumbersome backend. To solve mapping, I
      would continue to use MapBox. Mapbox GL is such a powerful tool that is
      the go to when it comes to any location-based application or feature. It
      allows for easily overlapping the locations of the POIs on any map we
      desire, or an entirely generated map using vector tiles. MongoDB Realm
      will be the key in handling backend logic for our application. It is a set
      of fully-managed application development services that will help solve
      multiple problems the mobile app may face. One of its main use cases is
      Realm Database, giving our app local storage to save photo data when the
      app is offline. In connection with MongoDB Atlas API and Atlas Device
      Sync, we can use
      <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/realm/introduction/">Realm</a> to
      automatically sync data taken from the mobile app to our webpage without
      bothering the user. Realm can also use Atlas App Services to query our
      MongoDB Atlas database to direct data to the webpage. This means the
      researchers should not have to worry about an internet connection when
      taking photos of POIs, and we should still be able to use Realm in the
      backend of our webpage for deliver data to Mapbox from a MongoDB Atlas
      cluster.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p style="font-size: 20px">
      To handle login and authentication. Realm and Atlas App Services also
      provides built-in user management. Since we are building a private and
      secure app specifically for researchers, we could use JSON Web Tokens as
      the format for our authentication tokens and OAuth2 as the protocol to
      ensure the researchers login data is secure. Luckily, Realm supports both
      <a
        href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/app-services/authentication/custom-jwt/#std-label-custom-jwt-authentication"
        >JWT authentication</a
      >
      and OAuth2.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p style="font-size: 20px">
      Finally, to store the data of the uploaded POIs I would recommend using
      MongoDB Atlas specifically. It is very similar to MongoDB itself but keeps
      our application lightweight without us having to manage it extensively.
      Additionally, our Realm backend can connect direcly with our MongoDB Atlas
      cluster in order to both send data from the mobile app to the database,
      and fetch the data to deliver to Mapbox and display on the webpage. To be
      specific, for the backend of the webapp, Realm's Web SDK will allow us to
      query the MongoDB database which is all we should need it to do, the rest
      of the functionality I described earlier is specific to the mobile apps.
      Here is an example of Realm being used together with Mapbox:
      <a
        href="https://www.mongodb.com/developer/products/mongodb/searching-nearby-points-interest-mapbox/"
        >Searching for POIs with MongoDB and Mapbox.</a
      >
    </p>
    <br />
    <p style="font-size: 20px">
      In summary to describe the flow of data and how it might look, I wanted to
      start with what happens when a researcher snaps a photo of a POI.
      Initially, that data will be stored likely as a pair of the image and its
      metadata (such as the location). This data will be stored in the mobile
      apps local Realm database until an internet connection is re-established.
      Once, the connection is re-established, that data will be transferred by
      Realm to our MongoDB Atlas cluster. There, the data will be stored in a
      document or collection as the image paired with its associated GeoJSON
      data. Realm then queries the Atlas cluster for the GeoJSON data which is
      then passed to Mapbox to generate tilesets that will be visible on the
      webpage application. Finally, we could develop a tooltip component to
      popup with the image of the POI and some associated information.
